# CipherApplication
A simple application that takes as input a text and according to a cipher, the output text will be encoded.
This is my first big application. This is an encoding application where, by introducing a text and choosing an algorithm, the output
will be the encoded version of the input. 
The application has 2 panels:
1. In the first panel you choose the algorithm and the offset. The offset can represent the distance between a letter and another. For ex:
if we have the letter 'a' and offset of 2, the result is 'c' because 'a' + 2 = 'c'. Some of the algorithms do not have an offset.
Additionally, there is a button to execute the algorithm.
2. In the second and last panel there are 2 panels: one is for an input text, the second is for the generated encoded input.

Note: this is unfinished. There are only 2 algorithms made so far: Caesar's Cipher and ROT13. In the future will be implemented Beaufort
and Autokey ciphers. Yopu must have the resolution 1920x1080 and a scale of 100% to work properly otherwise, the application will look muddy
and the components will break and alter.
